# H1 Development Process

I started the project by creating wireframes and user stories. Those gave me a good guideline to work with throughout the development of the game. I started working on the game board design in HTML, as well as the curl scripts for user authentication. Next up was the game logic, which initially felt like an insurmountable challenge. Getting the code for the logic started was one of the toughest challenges I faced during the development of this project. However, through the process of writing pseudocode I was able to get the game logic code started, and after that getting the logic completed was fairly straightforward. Once I had the logic figured out I began working on linking user and game actions to the API.

# H1 Unsolved Problems

I would like to work more on the styling of the entire app, to make it more visually appealing to the user.
